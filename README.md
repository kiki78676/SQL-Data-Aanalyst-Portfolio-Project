# 🧠 SQL Data Analyst Portfolio Project  

This project demonstrates end-to-end SQL data analytics inspired by **YouTuber Data With Baraa**.  
It showcases how SQL can be used to explore, segment, and visualize business insights from a sales dataset using **Microsoft SQL Server**.

## 📂 Repository Structure  
The csv_files folder contains all raw and processed datasets used for analysis and reporting.

The scripts folder includes all SQL scripts that perform trend, cumulative, performance, and segmentation analysis.

Each SQL script connects to the CSV data, performs calculations or transformations, and generates summarized reports.

The outputs from these queries feed into the report views (report_customers and report_products) for visualization or export.

The repository structure ensures clear separation between data, queries, and documentation for easier maintenance and scalability.
